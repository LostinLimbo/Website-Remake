    <p>Colin Noon having spent a career in Accountancy and Commerce set up Colin Noon Business Services some thirty years ago.</p>

    <p>Initially working by himself for a number of small local businesses his reputation soon grew and with an expanding client base took on carefully selected members of staff to assist the servicing of the ever developing and diversifying business.</p>

    <p>With the changes in the requirements for incorporated businesses to no longer have a necessity to have their annual accounts audited we have been able to make the most of our very much 'hands-on' style of attending to clients affairs and directed much effort into this area of the business community. With the benefit of working from a low cost base the client fees reflect the fact within the moderate charges made.</p>

    <p>We have always had a particular keenness to work with and assist the smaller business and we offer our clients the opportunity of being able to access and benefit from many of the services usually only available to larger concerns. You will find details of these services on our website.</p>

    <p>Personal Taxation is also a sphere that Colin Noon gets directly involved with and will help private individuals to minimise their liabilities to Revenue and Customs at a very modest cost.</p>

    <p>Owing to the popularity of Colin Noon Business Services and the fact that Colin Noon likes to always keep a personal watch over all of the clients the company tends to concentrate on servicing the local area but do retain quite a number of clients who have subsequently removed to further afield but do not want to seek a new accountant.</p>
